### Analysis of seasonal lake area evolution from satellite images

Investigated four seasonal lakes: Walker, George, Mono, and Melincu√©.

Developed a threshold-based method using non-shadow AWEI and cross-validation to monitor seasonal lake area changes over 38 years of Landsat imagery and assess their relationship with ERA5-Land runoff and evaporation data.

Generated time series of lake area evolution and created animated visualizations highlighting accurate detections and false positives across all satellite images.
